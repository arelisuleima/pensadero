Este es un ejemplo de una nota que quien sabe si vaya a funcionar 

In the city, uh
'Member you used to drive a Yukon
I pick up whenever you call
In the parking lot in Tucson, like
"Uh, are you with me?"
In the Phantom with the roof gone
I pull up like Jimmy Neutron
I can help you get a move on like U-Haul
And I know

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Uh, you like to go slow
But we could go faster
Tell me the password
Slide city, slide city
You know what that means, uh
I'm coming up on you quickly, mm
I bring nice things, uh
Slide city, slide
Plenty other men tryna get in the bed
So I'ma get slouched instead
I know it's gon' makе you beg

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
What would I do (What would I do?)
If I didn't love you, baby?
What would I do if I didn't love you, baby?
What would I do (What would I do?)
If I didn't lovе you?
