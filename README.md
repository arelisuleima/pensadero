# Pensadero

<img src="logos/pensieve-logo-rmv.png" alt="Logo" width="100"/>

A lightweight desktop notes widget built with EWW and Python. Organize thoughts
like Dumbledore’s Pensieve—without the risk of spilled memories.


## Why?

- Because _"The mind is not a book to be opened at will and examined at
  leisure"_ (but your notes should be).
- Works like a _pensieve_: dump thoughts, retrieve them later.

## Dependencies

- `EWW`.
- `Python`.
