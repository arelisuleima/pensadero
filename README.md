# Pensieve 🔮
A lightweight desktop notes widget built with EWW and Python. Organize thoughts like Dumbledore’s Pensieve—without the risk of spilled memories.
## Why?  
- Because *"The mind is not a book to be opened at will and examined at leisure"* (but your notes should be).  
- Works like a *pensieve*: dump thoughts, retrieve them later.  

## Dependencies  
- `EWW`.  
- `Python`.
